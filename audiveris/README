Audiveris.java is the entry point ot the program. I added the modified version that I used when I was running/debugging from Eclipse. But you can run the program with the audiveris-launch script. You might have to adjust the paths, but you can see the command-line parameters you need to run the script in batch mode. You might also need to adjust some of the paths in the script (twinkle.script), but you get the idea. The output will be twinkle.xml.
